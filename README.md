# suchp455w0rd: An old project for personal use to keep passwords hardly secure!
> as paranoid as psychos!

suchp455w0rd is really simple.(K.I.S.S.) 
It's not like other password saving mechanism in your hard disk.
It uses the most secure hard disk! Your brain!
For example, you wanna create an account for something like a CTF competition.
And you wanna a really strong password!(length = 64 or even more!)
So you can't memorise or save it somewhere in your daily driver.
You memorise another simple password and follow program instructions and prompts to create a strong hash password!

- As I said, It's not a real project with obvious goals and dead-line. It's a fun and usable project to be private! (Pull-requests are welcome!)
